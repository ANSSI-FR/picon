picon for Debian
----------------

picon-monitor is compiled with timeout feature deactivated. It means
that picon-monitor will not kill the monitored program if it receives
no signal from it. To activate this feature you need to rebuild the
monitor with this feature enabled. Indeed, for security reasons, it
cannot be enabled/disabled at runtime.
